  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a creative, self-directed, and solutions-oriented front-end developer
    with solid experience in HTML/CSS, CraftCMS, e-commerce user-flows, and
    JavaScript. As a front-end developer I enjoy working closely with marketing,
    creative and content teams to ensure that projects are built to scope and
    compelted in a timely manner.

    For the last year and a half I have been helping redevelop MacSales.com. I
    have helped with html/css and javascript development as well as integrating
    CraftCMS to manage content. I helped test and maintain our current build
    process and have created documentation along our journey. Prior to choosing
    CraftCMS for MacSales.com I used the powerful CMS to manage content for
    <a href="https://www.owcdigital.com">OWCDigital.com</a>.

  <p>Check out some of the redeveloped sectios of MacSales.com:</p>

    While working at Educational Service Center 13 I led web development project
    life cycle, from defining goals/needs and providing technical insights to
    testing and delivery, and adhered to clientâ€™s requirements. Designed
    applications with Bootstrap framework, ExpressionEngine, and Craft CMS. Some
    of the projects that I worked on are:
